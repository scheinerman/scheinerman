# Welcome

Welcome to my GitHub site. I am a professor at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) working in discrete mathematics. I am also 
an amateur coder and Julia enthusiast. I hope you find the packages provided here useful.

## Postcardware

The packages in my GitHub are under the MIT License which is very permissive. While it is not necessary (legally)
I do ask that if you find the code useful to send me a postcard. While I'd enjoy a real, physical postcard, an
electronic substitute is perfectly fine. Send me a photo of your home town, your university, your dog, or whatever
interesting image you'd like. My email address is `ers@jhu.edu`.

If you do send a physical postcard, please use this address:
```
Ed Scheinerman
Whiting School of Engineering Dean's Office
Johns Hopkins University
Baltimore, MD 21218 USA
```
And thanks!

## Contributing

I'm not fully comfortable with all the functionality of GitHub and my understanding of pull requests (and their management)
is marginal at best. If you want to add some functionality to a package, please reach out to me directly. The easiest 
thing for me is if your new code sits in its own file.
